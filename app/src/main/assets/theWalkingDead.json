When he wakes, he discovers that the world has been taken over by zombies, and that he seems to be the only person still alive. After returning home to discover his wife and son missing, he heads for Atlanta to search for his family. Narrowly escaping death at the hands of the zombies on arrival in Atlanta, he is aided by another survivor,Glenn,who takes Rick to a camp outside the town. There,Rick finds his wife Lori and his son,Carl, along with his partner/best friend Shane and a small group of survivors who struggle to fend off the zombie hordes; as well as competing with other survivor groups who are prepared to do whatever it takes to survive.<br><br>The Walking Dead is an American horror drama television series developed by Frank Darabont. It is based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. Andrew Lincoln stars as sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who awakens from a coma to find an apocalyptic world dominated by flesh-eating zombies, called \"walkers\". He sets out to find his family and encounters many other survivors along the way.",
